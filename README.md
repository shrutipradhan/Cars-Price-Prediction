# Cars-Price-Prediction
### Within the recent decade, car production has progressively expanded. This has given rise to the used automotive market, which has grown into a successful industry in its own right. Using Machine Learning Algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, Gradient Booster, and MLP Regression, we will aim to build a statistical model that can anticipate the price of a used vehicle based on past customer data and a certain variety of features. We  also analyse the estimation accuracy, and it is discovered that Gradient Booster performs the best.
